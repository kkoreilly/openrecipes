# Open Recipes

## About

This is a fork of the original Open Recipes project that is now archived. This fork works with Python 3 and Scrapy 2.9.0 and aims to work with the latest versions of the recipe sources. This is fork is not yet fully functional. Open Recipes is a set of Scrapy spiders that find recipes on various websites and create recipe bookmarks. There will be JSON files of recipe bookmarks uploaded at later dates.

## Recipe Bookmarks

The recipes in Open Recipes do not include preparation instructions. This is why Open Recipes is a database of recipe bookmarks. It provides everything you need to find good recipes, but not to prepare them. Preparation instructions can be found at the sources.
